# AutoCommit

**AutoCommit** is a Swift-based command-line tool that automatically generates Git commit messages using the **Gemini API**.  
Perfect for developers who want faster, cleaner, and more consistent commit workflows without typing messages manually.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Reads staged changes from Git (`git diff --cached`)
- Sends the diff to the Gemini API
- Generates concise and descriptive commit messages following best practices
- Automatically commits without manual message input

---

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Create the Command-Line Tool Project
```bash
# Go to your desired directory
mkdir AutoCommit
cd AutoCommit
swift package init --type executable
```

### 2. Replace main.swift
	1.	Open the Sources/AutoCommit/main.swift file in Xcode or your editor.
	2.	Replace its contents with the updated AutoCommit code.

### 3. Set Your Gemini API Key
Make sure you have a **Gemini API key**. Store it in an environment variable:
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```
To make it permanent, add it to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```
Then reload your shell:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 4. Build the Project
```bash
swift build -c release
```

### 5. Install the Command Line Tool
```bash
cp .build/release/AutoCommit /usr/local/bin/auto-commit
```
